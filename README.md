### Hello ðŸ¤ 

I like to work on too many projects at once

This profile is a set of repos mainly used for self-study...

However, I have pinned some repos - this is usually stuff that's finished or intended to be public facing.

### Currently Working On

Mostly trying to get better technically

However, there is 1 project which I wouldn't mind collaborating on:

[![Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=JJB9922&repo=MusiDoodle)](https://github.com/JJB9922/MusiDoodle)

It's a digital notepad for quickly jotting down musical ideas, intended for those who sit at their computer doodling on an instrument and stumble across inspiration

I have too many ideas for it and want the UX to be flawless, enabling musicians to make a digital record of musical ideas without hindrance

But, I'm slow to make substantial progress on it for a [variety of reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68W2fzN3ZiU)

### Background

Master's in Psychology, affinity for technology.

Work in Life Sciences Robotics ðŸ¤– (C# mostly, lil bit of React/TS)

Dependence on music / musicianship - (guitar, bass, piano, drums, recording & production)

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai and MMA / Bouldering to prevent the flesh shell from impeding the electric worm slab ðŸ§ 

Lastly, a sprinkle of [misfirings](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31536037/)
